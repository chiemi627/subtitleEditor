# Subtitle Editor (local web app)

This is a starter Vite + React + TypeScript project for editing SRT subtitles for local MP4 files.

Run locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- This app runs entirely in the browser and reads/writes files using the File API.
- Next steps: implement SRT parsing, subtitle editing UI, and export to SRT.
